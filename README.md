# Monsanto Simulator 2016

No longer under active development. Designed for an assignment in a Biology course.

## Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/markasoftware/monsanto-sim
cd monsanto-sim
npm install
```

## Running:

`node index.js`

Will be running on `127.0.0.1:1338`. Might want to use a tool like forever to keep it running better.
